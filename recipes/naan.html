    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A super tasty garlic naan recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup full-fat plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Cooking oil, for the bowl</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 stick melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a glass measuring cup, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit for 10 minutes. In the meantime, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the yeast mixture, yogurt, and milk and stir into the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Knead with your hands until the dough forms a smooth, soft ball, about 2 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and turn onto a well-floured surface. Knead it briefly and divide the dough into 12 equal portions.</li>
        <li>Roll it into 1/4-inch-thick ovals, approximately 6 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat. Sprinkle each portion with minced garlic and press it into the dough.</li>
        <li>Brush the dough with melted butter and place in skillet. Cook for about one minute, until the dough puffs up.</li>
        <li>Flip, cover the pan, and cook for one more minute.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan, brush both sides with butter, and sprinkle with salt. Place in a towel-lined bowl until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
